## Physical Robot Experiments
This repository demonstrates physical robot experiments for pursuit-evasion scenarios using our RAMP framework.

All experiments are conducted under the following conditions:

- 2×2m² experimental environment
- Two autonomous robots: a green evader and a red pursuer
- The evader must reach a designated goal while avoiding capture
- All robots operate under non-holonomic motion constraints
- Videos show split-screen views: lab setup (right) and trajectory visualization (left)
- Purple dashed line indicates the evader's initially planned high-level trajectory
