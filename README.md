# RAMP
Real-Time Adaptive Motion Planning via Point Cloud-Guided, Energy-Based Diffusion and Potential Fields

## Method Overview
Our experiments demonstrate how real-time adaptive motion planning can be effectively applied to pursuit-evasion scenarios with non-holonomic constraints. The RAMP framework leverages point cloud data and energy-based diffusion techniques to generate efficient trajectories in the presence of dynamic agent and static obstacles.
## Results

Below are simulation and physical robot demonstrations showcasing the capabilities of our RAMP framework.

# Physical Robot Demonstrations

## Experimental Setup

Our pursuit-evasion scenario experiments were conducted using the [QCar1 by Quanser](https://www.quanser.com/products/qcar/), a 1/10-scale autonomous vehicle platform designed for robotics and AI research. The platform features onboard sensors including an IMU, RGB-D camera, and LiDAR, along with motion capture markers for external tracking system integration. This configuration makes the QCar1 ideal for research in localization, control, and navigation applications.

## Large Environment 

### Workspace Configuration
All experiments are conducted under the following conditions:
- **Environment**: 6Ã—6mÂ² experimental area
- **Robots**: Two autonomous vehicles - blue evader and red pursuer  
- **Objective**: Evader must reach designated goal while avoiding capture
- **Constraints**: All robots operate under non-holonomic motion constraints
- **Visualization**: Split-screen videos showing lab setup (bottom) and trajectory visualization (top)


## Experimental Scenarios

Four pursuit-evasion experiments evaluated under varying obstacle densities:

**Experimental Conditions:**
- **Scenario 1**: 4 static obstacles (baseline environment)
- **Scenario 2**: 6 static obstacles (additional 2 unseen obstacles)

## Small Environment 

### Workspace Configuration
All experiments are conducted under the following conditions:
- **Environment**: 2Ã—2mÂ² experimental area
- **Robots**: Two autonomous vehicles - green evader and red pursuer  
- **Objective**: Evader must reach designated goal while avoiding capture
- **Constraints**: All robots operate under non-holonomic motion constraints
- **Visualization**: Split-screen videos showing lab setup (right) and trajectory visualization (left)

## Experimental Scenarios

Three pursuit-evasion experiments demonstrate our method performance under open and static obstacle configurations.
