# TorchRobotics

This library implements differentiable robot tree from URDF or MCJF robot format, and the differentiable planning objects such as obstacle avoidance, self-collision avoidance and via point.

**NOTE**: `torch_robotics` is under heavy development and highly experimental.

## Installation

Simply activate your conda/Python environment and run

```azure
pip install -e .
```

## Examples

To see FK, IK of all available robot kinematics

```azure
python examples/forward_kinematics.py
```

and

```azure
python examples/inverse_kinematics.py
```

## Acknowledgements

A part of this implementation is inspired from the library [differentiable robot model](https://github.com/facebookresearch/differentiable-robot-model).
